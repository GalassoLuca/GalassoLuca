# Ciao, I'm Luca 👋

I am a Senior Software Engineer, specializing in modern web technologies, with a strong focus on software scalability and performance optimization. Since my early years, I have been truly passionate about programming, always evolving my skills to deliver high-quality, scalable solutions.

Beyond the code, I am deeply committed to an active lifestyle and to environmental causes. I teach Acroyoga, and I enjoy rock climbing, bouldering, freediving, surfing, and surfskate.
